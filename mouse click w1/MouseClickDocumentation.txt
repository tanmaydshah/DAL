App #1
25th Feb to 1st March 2013

Objective: To use the LeChal shoes as a mouse-event controller (Left Click, Right Click, Scroll Up, Scroll Down)

Solution:
CLICKS: When the foot is tapped on the floor, it causes a spike in the Z-axis accelerometer readings. Using these values, smoothing them and setting a threshold to remove unwanted noise, taps are recognized and then converted to on-screen mouse events.

SCROLLING: Scrolling is activated only when both feet are raised (either from the heel or the toes). When X-axis accelerometer values for both feet cross a certain threshold, scrolling up or down is enabled. 

Language: Python, with PyMouse for mouse control.
